# private-rpc
Open source private RPC for solana exchange, subscribe to events to get token creation and trade data as well as make transactions with the UDP protocol for competitive transaction speeds that go straight to the validators to avoid MEV attacks. No more api transaction fees, mev fees taking up your profits or having to wait in line for others transactions to process only to get sandwiched by some nerd. You are now that nerd, you're welcome.

Update - Go is great but I am going to wait till I finish learning Rust to create a gRPC node. For now I am just going to make a simple api to make transactions directly to a validator that is closest to a specified city.
